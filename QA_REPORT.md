# QA Review Findings

## ✅ Draft management regression coverage
- Exercised the draft update and deletion code paths with unit tests so future changes cannot silently break the AJAX workflow again. The stubs emulate WordPress-less database objects and confirm `MealsDB_Client_Form::save_draft()` updates existing records while `delete_draft()` enforces affected-row checks. 【F:tests/test-client-form.php†L14-L199】【F:tests/test-client-form.php†L375-L409】【F:includes/class-client-form.php†L272-L360】

## ✅ AJAX endpoints resilience review
- Manually reviewed `MealsDB_Ajax` handlers to ensure each endpoint enforces capability checks, nonces, and propagates the form handler return values; no additional defects found during this pass. 【F:includes/class-ajax.php†L1-L116】

## ℹ️ Additional observations
- Deterministic index creation/backfill logic is defensive and idempotent; existing logging covers unexpected schema issues. No further action required after line-by-line audit. 【F:includes/class-client-form.php†L608-L824】

## Automated tests
